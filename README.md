# summer_census

This repository hosts materials from a research presentation and a workshop on spatial anslysis I did as part of the [**Summer at Census**](https://www.census.gov/topics/research/events/summer-at-census.html) program.

The research presentation *CSparks_Census_talk.html* focuses on the use of the INLA method for Bayesian regression to estimate spatial GLMM models.

The workshop is a 2 hour dive into exploratory spatial data analysis and a run through of using INLA to estimate a spatial GLMM for infant mortality data in US counties.
